# PracticalML - Course Project
==================================

```{r echo=FALSE}
# load all required packages
# set working directory
# download two data sources from URLs
trainURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
# do any other pre-work
```

## Executive Summary
1. Should be a gh-pages branch, <2000 words, <5 supporting figures
2. Goal: predict the manner, in which people did the exercise ("classe" variable)

## Data Processing
```{r}
# explain coefficients from the data set and how they will be used for prediction
```

## Model Selection
```{r}
# try several models, show the difference and select the best one
```

## Cross-Validation
```{r}
# split training data into several chunks and estimate our of sample error
```

## Out of Sample Error
```{r}
# present expected out of sample error
```

## Results for 20 Test Cases
```{r}
# present results
```
